# 30-Day AI Engineer Roadmap (From Python Basics → Mini-GPT)

**Goal:**  
Understand how ChatGPT-like models work from first principles and build a **tiny GPT model** in 30 days.

**Target Audience:**  
Beginner with basic Python knowledge (loops, functions, variables).

**Daily Time Commitment:**  
⏱ 2–3 hours/day  
🚫 No skipping days

---

## 📅 Roadmap Overview

- **Week 1:** Python + Math Foundations  
- **Week 2:** Machine Learning & Neural Networks  
- **Week 3:** Deep Learning & Transformers  
- **Week 4:** Training, Scaling & AI Systems Reality  

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Learn **why**, not just **how**
- Build things **from scratch** before using libraries
- Focus on **understanding**, not memorization
- Write notes & code every day
